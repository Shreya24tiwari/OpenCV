### Face Recognition
#### USE PYTHON LANGUAGE: 
#### OPEN SOURCE COMPUTER VISION LIBRARY:
OpenCV is a huge open-source library for computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. OpenCV supports a wide variety of programming languages like Python, C++, Java, etc. It can process images and videos to identify objects, faces, or even the handwriting of a human. When it is integrated with various libraries, such as Numpy which is a highly optimized library for numerical operations, then the number of weapons increases in your Arsenal i.e whatever operations one can do in Numpy can be combined with OpenCV.

This OpenCV tutorial will help you learn the Image-processing from Basics to Advance, like operations on Images, Videos using a huge set of Opencv-programs and projects.

#### HAAR CASCADE CLASSIFICATION:
It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images. Initially, the algorithm needs a lot of positive images (images of faces) and negative images (images without faces) to train the classifier.

#### GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE TKINTER:
Python offers multiple options for developing GUI (Graphical User Interface). Out of all the GUI methods, tkinter is the most commonly used method. It is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. Python with tkinter is the fastest and easiest way to create the GUI applications. Creating a GUI using tkinter is an easy task.

### OPEN SOURCE COMPUTER VISION LIBRARY 

Implement facial recognition system using Python, OpenCV module and tkinter along with the explanation of the code step by step in the comments.

### To create a complete project on Face Recognition, we must work on 3 very distinct phases:

#### Face Detection and Data Gathering

#### Train the Recognizer

#### Face Recognition
